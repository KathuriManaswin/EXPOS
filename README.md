# Expos Roadmap Repository

## Project Overview

This repository contains my progress through the [Expos Roadmap](https://exposnitc.github.io/), part of the OS Lab at NITC. Expos (Experimental Operating System) is an educational operating system designed to help students understand low-level system programming concepts. The roadmap guides through the step-by-step implementation of an operating system, covering various system components such as process management, memory management, and file systems.
